# Electric Production Analysis and Forecasting

This repository contains code for analyzing and forecasting electric production data using R.

## Overview
The provided R script performs the following tasks:
- Loading the electric production dataset
- Exploring the dataset's structure and contents
- Conducting time series indexing
- Handling missing values
- Decomposing the time series data
- Plotting trend lines and boxplots
- Generating seasonal plots
- Checking stationarity using statistical tests
- Removing seasonality to make the dataset stationary
- Applying moving averages and exponential smoothing methods
- Forecasting future values using exponential smoothing models

## File Description
- `Electric_Production.csv`: Dataset containing electric production data.
- `Electric_Production_Forecasting.R`: R script containing the code for analysis and forecasting.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Libraries Used
- `timeSeries`
- `forecast`
- `tseries`

## Instructions
1. Load the `Electric_Production.csv` dataset.
2. Run the R script `Electric_Production_Forecasting.R` to perform analysis and forecasting.
3. Ensure that all required R packages are installed before running the script.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your specific needs.
